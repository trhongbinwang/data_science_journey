The demo codes and projects you want to keep you updated
Things in this project. 
1. summary of useful libs such as Tensorflow, Xgboost, Spark etc. 
2. minimal implementation of popular ML algorithms. 
3. minimal re-implemenation of interesting projects. 

The principle is to simplify and re-create the working demo.
